# CompanyBio Explorer NC Capstone Project

## Description
The Bioexplorer NC Capstone Project is designed to help with analyze and visualize employee data using a simple filtering and cleaning to help find individual in the database for specific projects. This project provides tools for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and interactive visualizations to support Project planning research and Findings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BioexplorerNC.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

4. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the `NC Main Project.ipynb`.

3. Install the required dependencies:
    Which are in the first coding block prepared to run just for one time for the required dependencies.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    - jupyter notebook NC_Main_Project.ipynb.
    - after runing the pip install run the librarys every time restarting the kernal or program. 

3. Example usage:
    - Load your dataset in the specified format.
    - Run the preprocessing cells to clean and prepare your data.
    - Execute the analysis cells to generate insights and visualizations.

4. Run the connecting and swap main datavase to csv to run the csv file version the main database.

5. run the merge companybio csv coding block.

6. run the coding block that display the merge data.

7. run the cleaning data coding block
    - might need to run it twice in case the first time has an error.
    - the error goes away on the second run of the code block.

8. Run the filter code block
    - choose one or more checkboxes of column names.
    - hit the drop down menu for one of the items from the list within the columns from the database.
    - check inside visualstudio code to see the data displayed at the bottom of the coding block.
    - you can either close the pop up menu or click the close button ![#f03c15] `#f03c15`<code style="color : Red">Do not Hit The Stop Or Block Icon Where The Play Button Was.</code> That will cause the kernal to stop working and have to restart to step number 4.

9. When done with the filter block run the Last code block which is the Graphing program.
    - Select at least on column to plot data other wise it will ask you to select at least one
    - pop back into visual studio code at the bottom of the coding block to see the graph. 
    - to stop the code block either close the pop up menu or the close button in the TKinter menu below the Submit button.
